alert.py
========

This is a stupid-simple plugin for weechat that plays an alert when you
get a message, with a minimum wait time between alerts. There are plenty
of [existing scripts][1] that do this, but none quite that I saw that
were this simple. After failing to get a few of them to work in under a
minute, I just wrote this instead.

alert.py is barely any code, but in case you really care it is licensed under the MIT License.
